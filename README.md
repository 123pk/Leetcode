 <strong> 1. Repeated DNA Sequences </strong>
<br/>
<p>
   All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeate
   sequences within the DNA.
   <br/>

   Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

<strong> 2.Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row  </strong>
<br/>
<p>
 In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the ith domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.

<strong> 3.Asteroid Collision</strong>
<br/>
<p>
 We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
